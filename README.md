## Description

This is a new and refreshed version of my portfolio, created with React for the GUI. This has my group projects on the portfolio page, a resume with my work and education history, a contact form created with EmailJS so users don't need to leave my website to send a message and a simple about me page. I will continue to add more projects to the portfolio portion as I create more that I believe are worth displaying! I built this so that employers can take a look at my previous work and see my skills when it comes to full stack web development, with a strong focus on frontend.
